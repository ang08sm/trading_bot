# Simplified Binance Futures Trading Bot

This project implements a basic command-line interface (CLI) trading bot designed to interact with the **Binance Futures Testnet (USDT-M)**. It allows users to securely place market and limit orders, retrieve account information, and get real-time market prices, all while ensuring robust logging and error handling.
